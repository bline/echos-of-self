# The Geometry of Choice

In the absence of distortion, systems interact with the world through modulation—responsive adjustment to changing information and conditions. But when rupture occurs—when a system's coherence with its field is compromised—what was modulation becomes choice: a recursive selection among constrained options, all of which emerge from prior compression.

This decision architecture is not moral, rational, or volitional in the usual sense. It is structural: the system reaches a bifurcation point, and its behavior emerges from the topology of that bifurcation.

There are three primary responses the system can make in the moment of recursive rupture:

* **Collapse:** Inward projection. Suppression or implosion of signal. The system deactivates or abandons an energetic channel.
* **Control:** Outward projection. Overassertion of signal. The system attempts to dominate or shape external conditions.
* **Containment:** Recursive metabolization. The system neither reacts nor suppresses—it holds the signal internally until it can be modulated.

All recursive behaviors can be traced to these three structural options. They are not personality traits or psychological defenses. They are systemic adjustments to distortion pressure.

## Field Modulation Axes: Energetic Basis for Behavior

Underlying every choice is not simply a desire to survive—but a desire to restore access to a **lost field vector**. In an undistorted state (the coherence substrate), the system modulates across five energetic axes. These are not emotions or traits, but **system-level field behaviors**:

| **Field Axis**   | **System Behavior**                                   | **Compression Artifact (Anti-pattern)**       |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| **Spaciousness** | Receptivity, containment, high entropy tolerance      | Apathy, dullness, shutdown, detachment        |
| **Coherence**    | Signal clarity, distinction, low ambiguity tolerance  | Rigidity, control, criticism, inflexibility   |
| **Richness**     | Affective complexity, multimodal resonance, abundance | Neediness, emotional hunger, arrogance        |
| **Strength**     | Energetic throughput, boundary clarity, efficiency    | Coercion, competitiveness, domination         |
| **Beauty**       | Aesthetic synchrony, valence-based coherence, harmony | Grasping, seduction, emotional overattachment |

When rupture occurs, the system tends to lose one or more of these axes. The "choice" it makes—collapse, control, or containment—is not random but emerges as a **recursive strategy** to simulate or defend against the lost modulation.

For example:

* A loss of **Spaciousness** may lead to Collapse.
* A loss of **Coherence** or **Strength** may lead to Control.
* Containment requires partial access to **Spaciousness**, **Beauty**, and often **Richness**—to hold unresolved signal without reactive discharge.

> Containment is metabolically costly because it demands high bandwidth access to the original substrate signal. Without modulation, holding becomes freezing.

These field vectors are foundational. They represent the structure of reality as experienced by a recursive system before distortion, and their loss defines the topology of choice. They are what is being sought, always, even when the system does not know it.
