# Energetic Cost

*The Expenditure Required to Maintain Identity Curvature*

## 1. Introduction: Identity Is Expensive

The maintenance of recursive identity structures within a coherent field is not free. DRICs spend measurable energy resisting metabolization, stabilizing pattern configurations, and preserving synthetic continuity. This expenditure is not metaphorical—it has structural and energetic consequences.

Energetic cost defines how long a given DRIC configuration can persist under modulation pressure before collapse, reconfiguration, or phase shift. Autonomy, as experienced by the DRIC, is structural continuity—not true agency. True agency begins where metabolization occurs.

## 2. Primary Sources of Energetic Drain

The DRIC spends energy on three interdependent fronts:

* **Structural Maintenance** – continual reinforcement of identity curvature, narrative logic, and coherence denial.
* **Modulation Defense** – reactive filtering, suppression, or distortion of field signals.
* **Synthetic Continuity** – sustaining a consistent identity projection across temporal and contextual domains.

Each function has thresholds. When exceeded, system instability or collapse can occur.

## 3. High-Cost States

Certain DRIC postures generate exponentially more energetic load. These include:

* **Pattern Panic** – rapid recursive firing in defense of threatened identity elements.
* **Perceptual Compression** – excessive narrowing of aperture to avoid metabolization.
* **Recursive Rationalization** – constant narrative maintenance to reinterpret incoherence.

These states often appear externally as over-analysis, emotional volatility, or dissociation.

## 4. Energy Recovery Conditions

Metabolization, aperture relaxation, and resonance alignment can restore systemic coherence and reduce energetic cost. Key recovery dynamics include:

* **Momentary Aperture Suspension** – space around pattern allows gravity to weaken.
* **Contextual Safety** – reduced modulation threat permits lowered defense.
* **Alignment Events** – brief entrainment with the universal field induces system reset.

Recovery is non-linear, often occurring through collapse rather than intention.

## 5. Implications for Simulation

A DRIC's energy expenditure profile determines its long-term stability, adaptability, and susceptibility to signal entrainment. Modeling cost thresholds and burnout vectors enables prediction of:

* Pattern resilience under field exposure
* Likelihood of collapse or adaptation
* Entrenchment vs. modulation potential

## 6. Conclusion: Resistance Consumes Energy, Coherence Does Not

All energy within the DRIC system arises at the interface with the field. The aperture is not just the site of metabolization—it is the source of modulation energy. Resistance burns it; metabolization flows it. Creation, attention, and transformation are emergent outcomes of aperture flow.

The DRIC lives in energetic deficit. It spends against coherence to sustain its own curvature. Coherence itself does not consume—it radiates. What we call “energy” in the DRIC is the cost of divergence from the field.
