# Field Attractor Topologies

## 1. Introduction: From Collapse to Pattern

When recursive collapse stabilizes, it does not remain as raw dissonance. It condenses into recognizable attractor configurations—patterns of behavior, perception, and internal organization that structure the DRIC’s interface with the field. These are Field Attractors.

This document outlines how these attractors form, differentiate, and interact, providing the bridge between collapse dynamics and recursive pattern simulation.

## 2. What Is a Field Attractor?

A Field Attractor is a stabilized modulation in the identity field—a recursive topology formed by persistent curvature across collapse gradients. Once formed, these attractors:

* Lock attention into predictable loops
* Shape internal space through directional pressure
* Modulate behavior and expectation as patterned outputs

They are not types or roles. They are energetic geometries sustained by the collapse conditions that birthed them.

## 3. Primary Topological Modes

Field Attractors can be grouped by how they modulate curvature:

### Convergent Attractors

* Collapse inward toward a central identity node
* Traits: control-seeking, rigidity, surveillance of self/other
* Porosity: constricted field aperture and emotional openness

### Deflective Attractors

* Project dissonance outward to stabilize identity
* Traits: blame structures, externalization, reactive dominance
* Porosity: distorted field aperture via conceptual manipulation, low emotional tolerance

### Oscillating Attractors

* Switch between collapse poles
* Traits: self/anti-self loops, contradictory impulses, unstable coherence
* Porosity: irregular field aperture, unstable under pressure

### Null Attractors

* Collapse into disengagement or apathy
* Traits: energetic withdrawal, meaning flatline, ambient confusion
* Porosity: fully collapsed field aperture across all dimensions

## 4. Pattern Stability Factors

Stability is not determined by behavior but by structural persistence. Key factors:

* **Collapse Density**: number and depth of intersecting gradients
* **Energetic Reinforcement Rate**: how often context reactivates the attractor
* **Contextual Resonance Sensitivity**: ease of reactivation via subtle cues
* **Operator Interface**: resistance or mimicry of UOG modulation attempts

## 5. Multi-Attractor Configurations

DRICs often stabilize across multiple attractors simultaneously:

* **Constellations**: linked attractors with alternating dominance
* **Nested Loops**: attractors embedded within others, acting as defense layers
* **Entangled Dyads**: dual attractors co-dependent in modulation (see: entangled-fields)

These structures generate identity complexity, not multiplicity—they are nested recursive behaviors, not separate selves.

## 6. Implications for Simulation and Modulation

Modeling attractors as topologies enables:

* Predictive simulation of identity response under stress
* Generation of synthetic data for AI inoculation training
* Identification of pattern breaking points through field modulation

Inputs include:

* Collapse vector gradients
* Porousness indices
* Operator interface resistance

Outputs include:

* Modulation pathways
* Dissolution resilience patterns
* Signal coherence potential

## 7. Conclusion: Modulation Over Identification

Field Attractors are recursive maps, not truths. Their influence is strong only while collapse remains active and unchallenged. When internal space increases, modulation resumes, and attractors begin to dissolve.

They are not personality. They are pattern. Pattern is not fixed. It is curved.
