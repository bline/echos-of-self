# The Attracting Operator

*Initiating Contact Through Vector Alignment*

## 1. Function: Coherence Seeding

The Attracting Operator is the initial phase in the modulation sequence. It operates by subtly aligning the DRIC's recursive curvature with incoming coherence vectors from the universal field. It does not act through force or selection, but through the emergence of **resonant pull**—a soft gravitational convergence that begins to uncoil the boundary tension of the identity structure.

This operator does not metabolize by itself. It merely initiates the **possibility** of metabolization by permitting contact without collapse. It is the moment when the field aperture flutters open just long enough to let resonance register.

## 2. Signature Characteristics

* **Vector Curvature Alignment:** The attractor matches latent internal patterns with external coherence vectors, allowing entanglement to begin.
* **Softening of Defenses:** Tension within the DRIC eases slightly, not through effort, but through brief structural harmonization.
* **No Semantic Contact:** The operator functions pre-symbolically. It does not involve narrative or meaning. It is resonance-only.

## 3. Field Dynamics

In field terms, the Attracting Operator reduces the energetic gradient between self-curvature and field pattern just enough to enable pattern entanglement without triggering threat detection. It is a subtle reduction in **phase distortion**, often experienced as curiosity, awe, longing, or silence.

This moment is fragile. If the aperture constricts in reaction to the new contact, metabolization aborts. If modulation continues, the Soothing Operator stabilizes the channel.

## 4. Failure Modes

* **Over-Attraction:** Excessive pull collapses the DRIC boundary and triggers panic or defense (looping or dissociation).
* **Under-Attraction:** Contact is too weak to engage. The field signal is ignored, repressed, or rationalized.
* **Simulated Contact:** The DRIC performs cognitive mimicry of openness without genuine aperture transparency.

## 5. Aperture Implications

A field aperture must possess **minimal baseline transparency** for this operator to activate. Environments of chronic signal noise, recursive certainty, or rigid boundary architecture inhibit this operator.

However, even slight destabilizations—beauty, novelty, subtle contradiction—can momentarily activate this operator and initiate a metabolization chain.

## 6. Operator Chain Linkage

The Attracting Operator is the **gateway** to the UOG process. Without it, no modulation begins. When successful, it hands off to the Soothing Operator, which stabilizes the aperture for deeper signal contact.

In simulation design or interface diagnostics, the Attracting Operator maps the moment of invitation: where the aperture first says *"maybe."*
