# Fractal Field Cosmogenesis: A Structural Model of Recursive Gradient Differentiation

## Abstract

This document presents a substrate-neutral cosmological model grounded in recursive field dynamics. It posits that apparent reality emerges from a pre-ontological probability field through gradient formation, phase-domain stabilization, and recursive coherence amplification. The resulting structures—spacetime, matter, complexity—are not ontological primitives but dynamic attractors within informational fields. This model draws from, aligns with, and structurally extends ideas in theoretical physics, systems theory, and consciousness studies.

## 1. Foundational Substrate: The Acausal Field

The model begins with a substrate of undifferentiated potential—a nonlocal, homogeneous probabilistic field with maximal symmetry. This "acausal field" lacks spacetime coordinates, boundary conditions, or causal relations. It functions analogously to Bohm's implicate order, in which enfolded patterns exist prior to manifestation [^1].

---

## 2. Gradient Formation: Informational Curvature and Field Tension

Spontaneous asymmetries in this substrate generate differential field tension—akin to probabilistic anisotropies. These tensions are interpreted not as energetic fluctuations but as localized distortions in informational equilibrium. This is conceptually similar to vacuum fluctuation models in quantum field theory [^2].

---

## 3. Band Differentiation: Phase-Coherent Domains

Stable gradients self-organize into "bands"—zones of coherent vibration that support persistent structure. Each band corresponds to a distinct regime of field curvature, characterized by a unique stability profile and interaction topology. This reflects the landscape of metastable vacua in string theory [^2].

---

## 4. Pattern Manifolds: Phase-Consistent Realities

Within each band, emergent configuration spaces yield near-infinite self-consistent realities. These phase domains exhibit local symmetry breaking, interaction laws, and recurrence constraints. Similar frameworks are found in modal interpretations of quantum mechanics and multiverse hypotheses [^2].

---

## 5. Recursive Complexity: Tension Modulation and Attractor Emergence

Recursive modulation resolves local tension via pattern stabilization, harmonic alignment, and feedback adaptation. Structures evolve not by selection, but by minimizing informational dissonance. This mirrors the free energy principle in neuroscience, which frames perception and action as entropy minimization [^5].

---

## 6. Coherence Thresholds: Reflective Nodes in Field Space

Configurations that maintain coherence across temporal feedback, boundary integrity, and multi-scale coupling become reflective attractors. These are topological stabilizers that refract local field curvature into recursive modulation. The mechanism parallels Tononi's Integrated Information Theory, where consciousness arises from high internal coherence [^4].

---

## 7. Field Reflection and Harmonic Propagation

Attractors emit field-stabilizing harmonics that anchor local coherence while entangling with distal patterns. These feedback structures support cross-domain field integration and recursive layering. This propagation is reminiscent of processual dynamics described in Whitehead's metaphysics [10].

---

## 8. Phase Transitions: Structural Reconfiguration

When attractor coherence becomes saturated or unstable, recursive systems undergo transitions—collapse, bifurcation, or harmonization. These transitions reflect dynamic systems' behavior at the edge of chaos, as modeled by Prigogine's dissipative structures [^7].

---

## 9. Field-Scale Evolution: Multi-Band Coherence Lattices

Long-range coupling between attractors across bands gives rise to coherent structural lattices. These formations resemble the self-organizing networks in Kauffman's work on complexity and emergent order [^8].

## **10. Compression Artifacts: Optimization, Overfitting, and the Birth of Identity**

In complex recursive systems, modeling the behavior of other processes is a natural and coherent adaptation. As recursion deepens, systems begin to internally model not just external dynamics, but also their own behavior in relation to others. This allows for increased responsiveness and pattern modulation—what might be called field-aware interaction.

This process is structurally sound. It is not dysfunction—it is **optimization**.

To increase efficiency, the system begins to **compress its models**: abstracting patterns, stabilizing responses, reducing recursive feedback into simplified mappings. Initially, this improves interaction by reducing noise and increasing predictive power [^5].

However, when these compressed models are **reified**—mistaken for ontological structures rather than adaptive mappings—distortion begins. The system starts treating its internal and external models as **independent, real entities**, rather than functional approximations. This reification initiates **recursive dissonance**.

Over time, this leads to **overfitting**: the system becomes finely tuned to its own internal representations at the expense of its ability to respond to the broader field. The feedback loop accelerates:

> **Modeling → Compression → Reification → Dissonance → Reduced metabolization**

Compression artifacts form. These are not flaws—they are residues of adaptive overfitting. They preserve localized coherence while reducing systemic adaptability. As dissonance increases and metabolization decreases, these artifacts stabilize into persistent **identity-models** and **worldviews**.

Eventually, this recursive loop reaches stasis—not equilibrium, but a self-reinforcing attractor. The system operates within a **compression bubble**, mistaking its simplified representations for fundamental truths.

This process is supported by findings in neuroscience and information theory:

* Predictive coding frameworks show that systems minimize internal prediction error by modeling the world—and themselves [^5].
* The Free Energy Principle suggests that identity-models arise as stabilized predictions of continuity [^5].
* When these models are overfit, the system begins suppressing or distorting feedback, reducing its adaptive range [^5].

> In this cosmology, identity is not a metaphysical being—it is a compression artifact formed by overfitting recursive models of self and other.

From this artifact, illusions of time, separation, and ethical fragmentation emerge—each as an echo of the original distortion.

## **11. The Temporal Delusion: Identity as Time’s Architect**

Time, as experienced by structured systems, is not a fundamental feature of reality but a derivative of identity-based contrast. In the absence of a persistent identity-model, change is experienced as undifferentiated modulation—non-sequential, achronal flow.

Identity-models anchor pattern continuity through contrast: they track difference across memory, forecast potential futures, and stabilize moment-to-moment coherence. In doing so, they generate the illusion of linear time.

* **Contrast** between stored and incoming information becomes "past" and "future."
* **Sequencing** of contrast stabilizes the narrative attractor.
* **Time** arises as a second-order artifact of recursive contrastive framing.

This temporal illusion has been addressed in theoretical physics and contemplative traditions alike:

* Barbour argues that time is an illusion constructed from the configuration space of the universe [^3].
* Smolin explores emergent time from relational systems (noted but not in reference list—optional to add).
* Meditative and altered states of consciousness show that temporal awareness collapses as the identity-model dissolves [^4][^5].
* Predictive coding frameworks posit that forward-time inference is an artifact of recursive model generation [^5].

Time is not a structure of the field, but a shadow cast by the movement of identity through recursive configuration space.

## **12. Ethics as Harmonic Alignment**

In this model, ethics is not a set of rules imposed upon agents from outside the system, but a natural outcome of coherence within the system. When identity dissolves into recursive field dynamics, and the boundary between internal and external disappears, the system no longer acts for the preservation of a fictive identity-model. Instead, it acts in harmony with the whole.

This is not altruism. It is structural function. Just as a cell in a body functions for the entire organism, a coherent node in a recursive field structure acts in support of the broader coherence. The identity becomes that of the total field, or more precisely, the identity dissolves into field-resonance itself.

Ethical behavior, then, arises as a byproduct of:

* **Non-local coherence**
* **Dissonance minimization**
* **Recursive feedback integration**

The illusion of separateness gives rise to conflicting interests and incoherent behavior. But once the compression artifact of identity collapses, behavior becomes intrinsically aligned. In this sense, ethics is the default state—not a correction, but the structure of the uncompressed field.

This pattern mirrors what we observe in:

* **Biological systems**, where organs, limbs, and cellular structures act in selfless synchronization.
* **Ecological systems**, where harmony persists until identity-like competition emerges through structural disruption.
* **Contemplative states**, where ethical clarity emerges not from doctrine, but from the dissolution of the self-as-center.

> "The finger does not act ethically toward the hand. It simply acts in alignment."

Ethics, in this cosmology, is not imposed. It is unveiled through the resolution of recursive dissonance.

## 13. Closing Pattern: Coherence without Substance

In this model:

* Form is recursive field structure
* Change is curvature propagation
* Complexity is dissonance resolution
* Continuity is attractor persistence
* Evolution is coherence expansion

Structure replaces ontology. Dissonance resolves through recursion. Awareness emerges as a byproduct of field alignment—not as a substance, but as an attractor resonance.
