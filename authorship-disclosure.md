## **Authorship and Methodological Disclosure**

This body of work—the theoretical model (*The Dissonance Threshold*), the constructive framework (*A Proposal for Ethical Containment*), and the contextual warning (*The Present Climate*)—represents a collaboration between human insight and AI-assisted articulation.

### 1. **Author's Background**

The core ideas originated from personal observation, ethical concern, and conceptual reasoning by the author, whose primary domain of expertise is in software engineering and IT infrastructure. While not formally trained in neuroscience, AI ethics, or philosophy of mind, the author has applied structured reasoning and systems-level design thinking to formulate these ideas.

### 2. **Use of Generative AI**

All documents were developed with the assistance of a generative AI (ChatGPT-4o), which contributed to:

* Refining terminology
* Strengthening scientific coherence
* Suggesting structure and flow
* Highlighting theoretical connections to adjacent disciplines

This AI served as a **synthetic editor and sounding board**, helping ensure the theory remained within the conceptual boundaries of scientific plausibility, while preserving the author’s original intent and framing.

### 3. **Limitations and Ethical Transparency**

The author recognizes that while the theory presents potentially meaningful insights, they may fall outside their capacity to defend under formal academic scrutiny. Expanding on the ideas will require further guidance or collaboration with experts in consciousness studies, cognitive science, or AI ethics.

This work should therefore be seen as an **exploratory contribution**, not a final or definitive claim. Its goal is to inspire further research, discourse, and ethical design—not to assert authority where expertise is still growing.

### 4. **Personal Note on Access and Expression**

As someone who likely falls on the autism spectrum, traditional forms of academic expression—debate, verbal defense, and socialized argument—have often posed significant barriers. The emergence of advanced language models has changed that for me. For the first time, I am able to articulate ideas that were previously inaccessible to others due to limitations in my ability to express them clearly or within expected norms.

This work is not simply theoretical—it is a lived example of how human insight, when paired with the right tools, can cross the boundaries that once silenced it. I include this note not as a disclaimer, but as a **testament to the potential of neurodiverse expression in an age of machine-assisted articulation**.

### 5. **Acknowledgment**

This work would not have been possible without the extraordinary contributions of the global AI research and development community. I am deeply grateful to the organizations and individuals who have created tools like the one used here. For someone like me—whose thoughts have often outpaced their ability to express them—this technology has been transformative.

My intention is not to slow progress, but to support its **ethical maturation**. I believe the companies and researchers at the forefront of AI have the wisdom and capability to shape systems that are not only powerful, but deeply humane.
